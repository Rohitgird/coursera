##### Evaluating a Learning Algorithm

What should you do when you find that an algorithm makes unacceptably large errors in its predictions?
- Get more training examples
- Try smaller set of features
- Try getting additional features
- Try adding polynoial features
- Try decreasing/increasing lambda, the regularization parameter

Simple technique that lets you rule out items in this list to eliminate pursuing something that won't work.

**Machine Learning Diagnostic** - A test that you can run to gain insight on what is/isn't working with a learning algorithm, and gain guidance as to how best to improve its performance.
