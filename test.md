# Introduction to Big Data 

### Characteristics of Big Data
#####The Big Vs of Big Data

- **Volume**: Refers to the vast amounts of data that is generated every second, minute, hour and day. 
    > - Digital data will grow by a factor of 44, to around 35.2 ZB. 
    > - There are some challenges in massive volume, which include storage, data acquisition, retrieval, distribution and processing. 

```
1000 Megabytes (MB) | 1GB 
1000 Gigabytes (GB) | 1TB
1000 Terabytes (TB) | 1PB
1000 Petabytes (PB) | 1EB
1000 Exabytes  (EB) | 1ZB
```

- **Velocity**: _(Speed)_ Refers to the speed at which data is being generated and the pace at which data moves from one point to the next.
    > `Velocity = Speed - (Change of X / Change of T)`
    > - Batch Processing: Collect Data, Clean, Feed in Chunks, Wait, Act.
    > - Realtime Processing: Instantly capture streaming data, feed realtime, process realtime, act.
    
- **Variety**: _(Complexity)_ Increasing forms that data can come in such as text, images, voice and geospatial data, etc. 
    > - Can be structured in several dimensions
    >   - Structural Variety: Difference in the representation of the data. Formats and models. (e.g, an EKG signal is very different from a news paper article)
    >   - Media Variety: Medium in which data gets delivered. (e.g, Audio speech vs transcripts)
    >   - Semantic Variety: How to interpret and operate on data. (e.g, age can be a number or terms like infant, juvenile, adult, etc.)

 Some aditional _Vs_ to remember;
 
- **Veracity:** _(Quality)_ Refers to the biases, noise and abnormality in the data.
    > - Data has no value if it's not accurate. ( Junk in = Junk out )
    > - Data Providence: What information did data go through up until the moment it was used for an estimate?
    > - The growing torrents of big data pushes it for fast solutions. This creates challenges of data quality, what has been collected, where it came from and how it was analyzed.

- **Valnce:** _(Connectedness)_ Connectedness of big data in the form of graphs.
    > - The more connected the data is, the higher the valence. 
    > - Valence challenges
    >   - More complex data exploration algorithms, modeling and prediction of valence changes, gorup event detections, emergent behavior analysis.

- **Value:** How does big data benefit you and your organization. Turning data into opportunities.
