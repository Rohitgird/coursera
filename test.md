- **Velocity**: Refers to the speed at which data is being generated and the pace at which data moves from one point to the next <br>

> - Velocity = ( Speed - (Change of X / Change of T) )
> - Batch Processing: Collect Data, Clean, Feed in Chunks, Wait, Act.
> - Realtime Processing: Instantly capture streaming data, feed realtime, process realtime, act.
    
- **Variety**: Increasing forms that data can come in such as text, images, voice and geospatial data, etc. <br>

##### Additional V's 
- **Veracity**<br>
- **Valnce**<br>
- **Value**<br>
