# Introduction to Big Data 

### Characteristics of Big Data
#####The Big Vs of Big Data
- **Volume**: Refers to the vast amounts of data that is generated every second, minute, hour and day. <br>
    - Digital data will grow by a factor of 44. ~ 35.2 ZB
    - Challenges in massive volumes
        - Storage, Data Acuisition, Retrieval, Distribution, Processing
    - **Summary:** Volume is the dimension of big data related to it's size and it's exponential growth.


Test | Test
--- | ---
1000 Megabytes (MB) | 1GB 
1000 Gigabytes (GB) | 1TB
1000 Terabytes (TB) | 1PB
1000 Petabytes (PB) | 1EB
1000 Exabytes (EB)  | 1ZB


- **Velocity**: Refers to the speed at which data is being generated and the pace at which data moves from one point to the next <br>
    - **Velocity** = ( Speed - (Change of X / Change of T) )
    - **Batch Processing:** Collect Data, Clean, Feed in Chunks, Wait, Act.
    - **Real-Time Processing:** Instantly capture streaming data, feed real time, process real time, act.
    - **Summary:** Streaming data gives information on what's going on now, and gets generated at varied rates
    
    
- **Variety**: Increasing forms that data can come in such as text, images, voice and geospatial data, etc. <br>

##### Additional V's 
- **Veracity**<br>
- **Valnce**<br>
- **Value**<br>
